# ChatInput
Chat input Textarea designed for displaying html elements and emoji in the textarea. Since native textareas does not support displaying html elements, therefore it uses the contentEditable={true} for div. This react component is useful for chat/comments applications. User can define trigger points to display intellisense menu to choose the emoji or any html component given. For example ":" can be used to trigger emoji drop down menu or "@" can be used to trigger to tag users.
